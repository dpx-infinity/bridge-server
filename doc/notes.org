#+TITLE: Bridge notes

* Configuration
** Communicators
When reading communicator port address, it is converted/resolved to proper IP
address and then checked across all network interface addresses. If it is not
present among these addresses, it is an error. If it is present, its subnet
mask is taken too.

* Discovery
Bridge nodes can discover each other across the network. Discovery behavior
configuration is divided in two parts - discovery and exposition
configuration. There is also one common setting, a list of *discovery ports*.

Discovery configuration specifies the following:
 - on which interfaces the discovery should be performed;
 - in which subnets the discovery should be performed;
 - on which addresses the discovery should be performed (*statics*);
 - at which interval of time the discovery should be performed (in ms).

Exposure configuration specifies the following:
 - on which interfaces the node should be exposed;
 - on which addresses the node should be exposed.
